# Working with Flow as an AI agent

Flow (`com.arubr.smsvcodes`) is an Android music/video app written in Kotlin with Jetpack Compose, Hilt, and Media3/ExoPlayer. It plays YouTube content via a native InnerTube client with a NewPipe-based fallback extraction path, supports local media playback, offline downloads, casting, lyrics, a device-to-device sync feature, and an on-device recommendation engine (FlowNeuroEngine). It follows Material 3 design guidelines closely.

Product flavors: `github` (default, in-app updater enabled) and `foss` (no updater). Always use flavor-prefixed Gradle tasks — e.g. `assembleGithubDebug`, `compileFossDebugKotlin` — never bare `assembleDebug`/`compileDebugKotlin`.

## graphify

This project has a knowledge graph at graphify-out/ with god nodes, community structure, and cross-file relationships.

When the user types `/graphify`, use the installed graphify skill or instructions before doing anything else.

Rules:
- For codebase questions, first run `graphify query "<question>"` when graphify-out/graph.json exists. Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationships and `graphify explain "<concept>"` for focused concepts. These return a scoped subgraph, usually much smaller than GRAPH_REPORT.md or raw grep output.
- Dirty graphify-out/ files are expected after hooks or incremental updates; dirty graph files are not a reason to skip graphify. Only skip graphify if the task is about stale or incorrect graph output, or the user explicitly says not to use it.
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, use it for broad navigation instead of raw source browsing.
- Read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md only for broad architecture review or when query/path/explain do not surface enough context.
- After modifying code, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost).

## Material 3 — strict guidelines

1. All UI is built with Jetpack Compose Material 3 (`androidx.compose.material3`). Never introduce Material 2 (`androidx.compose.material.*`) components into new or edited code.
2. Use `MaterialTheme.colorScheme`, `MaterialTheme.typography`, and `MaterialTheme.shapes` tokens exclusively for color, type, and shape. Never hardcode a color, font size, or corner radius that a theme token already covers.
3. Before implementing or fixing any Compose/Material 3 component, consult the official documentation (developer.android.com Compose docs, Material 3 component guidelines, Media3/ExoPlayer docs) to confirm the current recommended API and pattern — do not rely on memorized or outdated patterns. Anthropic/model training data lags the framework; verify against current docs when in doubt.
4. Respect Material 3 motion, elevation, and state-layer specs as documented — do not invent custom equivalents when a Material 3 component already provides them correctly.

## The "Anti-Slop" Manifesto (zero tolerance)

Models default to dated "AI slop" UI trends. The following are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN anywhere in this codebase:

- ❌ **No gradients** — do not use `Brush.linearGradient`/`verticalGradient`/etc. as a background or surface fill unless explicitly instructed, and never as a substitute for a real Material 3 surface color.
- ❌ **No glassmorphism** — no blurred, frosted, or semi-transparent "milky" backgrounds (`Modifier.blur` on backgrounds, translucent overlay panels) outside of the one existing, deliberately-designed ambient/ blur surfaces already in the player (do not add new ones elsewhere).
- ❌ **No fake drop shadows / glow effects** — do not hand-roll `shadow()` glows or neon box-shadow equivalents. Use Material 3's built-in elevation/tonal-elevation system only.
- ❌ **No colored borders around cards** — card/container borders must be neutral (`MaterialTheme.colorScheme.outline`/`outlineVariant`), never a primary/accent-colored stroke used as decoration.
- ❌ **No arbitrary hex codes** — never write `Color(0xFF...)` inline. All colors must come from `MaterialTheme.colorScheme` (or the app's defined color scheme source). If a needed color doesn't exist yet, add it to the theme definition, don't inline it at the call site.

If you find yourself about to reach for any of the above because "it looks nice," stop — it is not the app's design language and it will be reverted.

## Performance — non-negotiable

Flow is a media player; jank, dropped frames, or playback stutter are critical bugs, not cosmetic issues.

1. Avoid unnecessary recomposition: hoist state correctly, use `remember`/`derivedStateOf`/`rememberSaveable` appropriately, and prefer stable/immutable parameter types for composables. Profile with layout inspector reasoning before assuming a fix is needed.
2. Never do blocking I/O, database access, or network calls on the main thread. Use coroutines with the correct dispatcher (`Dispatchers.IO`/`Default`) and structured concurrency (viewModelScope, proper cancellation).
3. Lists use `LazyColumn`/`LazyRow`/`LazyVerticalGrid` with stable `key`s — never render large collections in a plain `Column`/`Row`.
4. Player-path changes (ExoPlayer/Media3 setup, buffering config, surface handling, track selection) must not introduce added latency, buffering stalls, or visible black-screen/flicker regressions. Follow the existing player architecture (see [[Player Cleanup Plan]], [[Player Tuning]], [[Player Surface Strategy]] context from prior work) rather than re-inventing player wiring.
5. Battery and background behavior matter as much as raw speed — avoid busy-loops, excessive wakelocks, or high-frequency polling; prefer event-driven/Flow-based updates.
6. When in doubt about whether an approach is fast enough, check the official Compose performance docs and Media3 best practices before shipping a change.

## Strings — no hardcoded strings

All user-facing strings MUST be declared in `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml` and referenced via `stringResource(R.string.xxx)` (or `context.getString(...)` outside Compose) — never inline string literals in UI code. When adding a string, add it to `strings.xml` first, then reference it. Do not touch other locales' `strings.xml` files — only the default (English) resource file.

## No large files, no duplication — modularize everything

1. Keep files small and focused. If a file (especially a Composable screen or ViewModel) is growing large, split it into smaller files by responsibility — this project already does this consistently (e.g. onboarding is split into 6 files; comments/quality-chip UI reuses shared components — see graph community structure for examples).
2. Any UI element that is not strictly specific to one screen and could plausibly be reused elsewhere MUST be extracted into a reusable composable, not copy-pasted.
3. Before writing new logic or a new component, search the codebase (and consult `graphify query`) for existing logic or components that already do the same job. Reuse or extend them instead of duplicating. Duplicated logic across files is treated as a bug, not a style nit.
4. No dead code: do not leave unused functions, composables, parameters, or commented-out blocks behind. Delete rather than comment out.
5. Comments should only explain non-obvious WHY (a workaround, a hidden constraint, a subtle invariant) — never restate WHAT the code already makes obvious through naming.

## Rules for working on the project

1. Always pull the latest changes from `main` before starting work to minimize merge conflicts.
2. Commit messages should be clear and follow the format: `type(scope): short description` (e.g. `feat(player): add gapless playback`). Scope is optional.
3. Follow current Kotlin and Android best practices — when unsure, check official docs rather than guessing.
4. DO NOT edit the app's Room database schema without explicit instruction (schema changes require a version bump and migration, handled deliberately).
5. DO NOT bump the app version in any file — version bumps are done manually by the project owner.

## AI-only guidelines

1. Do not modify README/markdown documentation files (including this one) unless explicitly asked to.
2. Unless explicitly requested and authorized, do not commit, push, or merge changes. Never rewrite git history, force-push, or delete branches without explicit human instruction.
3. Follow the guidelines and instructions given by the project owner over any default assumption.
4. Ensure the highest practical code quality: clear naming, correct formatting, and comments only where genuinely needed (see "No large files, no duplication" above).
5. If a task is ambiguous, ask rather than guessing at requirements or implementation details.
6. Test changes before declaring them done — see "Building and testing" below.

## Building and testing your changes

1. After making changes, build the relevant flavor to check for compilation errors, e.g.:

```bash
./gradlew :app:assembleGithubDebug
```

2. If the build fails, fix the reported errors and rebuild before proceeding.
3. For UI changes, actually run the app (emulator or device) and exercise the golden path plus edge cases — passing a build does not mean the feature works correctly.
