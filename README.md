## Why Flow?

Most open-source YouTube clients give you playback but no way to discover new content. You either use the official app and get tracked, or you use an alternative and lose recommendations entirely.

Flow gives you both. The recommendation engine learns what you like by analyzing your watch behavior locally. It never leaves your devices. You can inspect everything it knows about you, adjust it, or wipe it at any time.

---

### Stable Release

<div align="center">
  <a href="https://github.com/A-EDev/Flow/releases/latest"><picture><source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="https://assets.flow-tube.org/v1/badges/pill/get-github-dark.svg"><img alt="Get it on GitHub" src="https://assets.flow-tube.org/v1/badges/pill/get-github-light.svg" height="60"></picture></a>

#### Which APK should I download?

Each release has six APKs: three device types, each in a GitHub build and a FOSS build.

| Your device | GitHub build | FOSS build |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Most phones and tablets (64-bit, `arm64-v8a`) | `flow-arm64-v8a.apk` | `flow-foss-arm64-v8a.apk` |
| Older 32-bit phones (`armeabi-v7a`) | `flow-armeabi-v7a.apk` | `flow-foss-armeabi-v7a.apk` |
| Any device (universal, larger download) | `flow.apk` | `flow-foss.apk` |

- **Not sure?** `flow-arm64-v8a.apk` works on almost every phone. `flow.apk` works on all of them.
- **GitHub build:** updates itself from inside the app and supports Discord Rich Presence.
- **FOSS build:** the same app without the built-in updater and the Discord integration. This is the build on IzzyOnDroid; update it through IzzyOnDroid or Obtainium.
- `checksums.txt` in each release lists the SHA-256 of every APK.

### Nightly Build
> ⚠️ Nightly builds are unstable and may contain bugs. Use at your own risk.

Flow Nightly is built from every commit to `main`. It installs next to the stable app as a separate app called **Flow Nightly**, keeps its own data, and updates itself to each new nightly from inside the app.

### Requirements 
**Minimum Requirement:** Android 8.0+
<a id="cert"></a>
### Verifying Authenticity
To ensure the authenticity of the APK and verify it has not been tampered with, you can check the signing certificate fingerprint using tools like [AppVerifier](https://github.com/soupslurpr/AppVerifier).

**Release Certificate SHA-256 Fingerprint:**
`43:22:29:4E:D4:CA:A2:D4:29:41:40:09:58:18:08:0F:FE:8A:CC:1F:BE:3C:DC:76:10:7D:F4:5C:52:86:BE:40`
